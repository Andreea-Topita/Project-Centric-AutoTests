# Demo Web Shop Automated Test Suite

This project was developed as part of the **‚ÄúSoftware Product Testing‚Äù course organized by Centric IT Solutions**, where I gained hands-on experience with both manual and automated software testing techniques. The course covered essential concepts in software quality assurance, from test planning to execution, defect management, and reporting in Agile environments.

## üìö About the Course

Throughout this practice-oriented course, I learned to apply key testing principles and methodologies, including:
- **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** and **Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC)**
- Test levels and test types (unit, integration, system, acceptance)
- Defect management using **JIRA** for bug tracking and reporting
- Creating and managing **test documentation**: test cases, test scenarios, and test plans
- Applying **Agile testing practices** within iterative development cycles
- Working with both **manual and automated testing techniques**

## üìå Project Overview

This project demonstrates a full **end-to-end automated test suite** for the [Demo Web Shop](http://demowebshop.tricentis.com/) e-commerce site, implemented in **C# using Selenium WebDriver**, following the **Page Object Model (POM)** design pattern.

The test suite covers core user workflows, including:
- **Authentication:** logging in and out
- **Product browsing:** sorting by price and selecting items
- **Cart operations:** adding specified quantities and then emptying the cart
- **Combined scenario:** chaining login, purchase, cart cleanup, and logout in one flow
